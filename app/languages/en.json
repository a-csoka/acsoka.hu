        "introduction": "Welcome to my website! I am currently studying Computer Science BSc at the Faculty of Information Technology, University of Pannonia. I have been consciously preparing for this career since high school: first earning a qualification as a Computer System Maintenance Technician, then as a Software Developer and Tester. Since then, I have been continuously expanding my knowledge through university studies, personal projects, and online courses. My goal is to complement my theoretical knowledge with practical experience, building up-to-date and solid foundations for future challenges. I am particularly interested in web and mobile application development. Precision, high-quality work, and openness to teamwork are especially important to me. I have good collaboration and organizational skills, and I plan and execute my tasks efficiently. I believe that continuous learning and hands-on experience are essential for growth, which is why my portfolio showcases projects that best reflect my interests, development path, and professional goals."
